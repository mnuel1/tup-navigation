TUP Navigation: Electron App

This Electron app provides indoor navigation services specifically tailored for the Technological University of the Philippines (TUP). Similar to Google Maps, it offers users a map interface for navigating the university's campus. Utilizing ant colony optimization algorithms, it calculates the most efficient paths from point A to point B within the campus premises. Users can input their starting and destination points, and the app will display the optimal route for them to follow. Whether you're a student, faculty member, or visitor, TUP Navigation simplifies navigation within the university's grounds.
